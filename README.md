# Virtual Simulator for DC Traction Power Supply System

## Overview
The **Virtual Simulator for Analysis of Voltage Drops and Short Circuits in the DC Traction Power Supply System** is a Python-based software developed to simulate the electrical behavior of a **3 kV DC traction system**. This program allows users to analyze various railway electrification parameters, including:

- **Voltage drops** in traction networks.
- **Substation performance** under different operating conditions.
- **Short-circuit scenarios** to evaluate system faults and responses.
- **Current distribution** across different traction power supply configurations.

The simulator was initially developed as part of a **bachelor’s thesis at Warsaw University of Technology**, aiming to modernize railway electrification studies by replacing traditional physical laboratory experiments with a flexible digital environment.

If you would like to have a look at the thesis itself, it is uploaded as a PDF with the name 'Virtual_Simulator_DC_Traction_Seunghyun_Yoo_2024'
